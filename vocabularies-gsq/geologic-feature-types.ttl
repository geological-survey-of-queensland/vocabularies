However, as the ISG usage better suits the nomenclature applied to some complex rock units in Queensland, it is therefore provisionally followed. A complex, although unranked in the NASC, was considered to be â€˜commonly comparable to suite or supersuiteâ€™, such that two or more associated complexes could be grouped in a supersuite. This problematical application of lithodemic nomenclature was addressed by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy with their introduction of the term â€˜supercomplexâ€™ and attendant recommendation for a two-fold hierarchy of rank for lithodemic rock units: lithodeme, suite and supersuite; and complex and supercomplex. Here, complex rock units are separated from lithostratigraphic and other single-class units (e.g., intrusive rock units) and broadly treated as stand-alone, largely nonstratiform, mixed-class units, thus reflecting the approach of Gillespie & Leslie (2021) in their construction of the British Geological Surveyâ€™s rock classification system (BRUCS). [Also, following Gillespie & Leslie, the NASC lithodemic terminology is not followed, and â€˜suiteâ€™ rankings are applied solely to intrusive rock units (not also to metamorphic units)]. However, as indicated, nomenclatural usage in Queensland is not true to the more restricted definition of rock complexes comprising more than one genetic class of rocks (e.g., Jell, 2013)."@en ;

This approach thus differs from that proffered by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in the â€˜International Stratigraphic Guideâ€™/ISG (e.g., Salvador, 2013; Murphy & Salvador, Online), which regards â€˜stratigraphyâ€™ as embracing the description of all classes of rocks (sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic) forming the Earthâ€™s crust and their organisation/classification into distinctive, useful, mappable units based on their inherent properties or attributes, in order to establish their distribution and relationship in space and their succession in time. The NASC (2005) introduced the term â€˜lithodemic unitâ€™ to encompass (predominantly intrusive, highly metamorphosed, or intensely deformed) rocks that do not obey Stenoâ€™s (1669) Law of Superposition (as opposed to a â€˜lithostratigraphic unitâ€™ which encompasses rocks that conform to this Law). The NASC lithodemic classification for non-stratified (nonstratiform) rocks, employing the terms â€˜Lithodemeâ€™, â€˜Suiteâ€™ and â€˜Supersuiteâ€™, was accepted by Kumpulainen (2017), such that lithodemic (non-stratified/nonstratiform) rocks and lithostratigraphic (stratified/stratiform) rocks were considered to be different, requiring different approaches to their classification. But, lithodemic terminology, per se, has not been embraced here, as it was also used to incorporate a rock â€˜complexâ€™(as a non-ranked, lithodemic unit). Rock complexes are here separated from other rock types (and, in an associated rock-unit-rank ontology, accorded rank: supercomplex, complex, etc.), with a comparable approach being adopted by Gillespie & Leslie (2021) in the British Geological Surveyâ€™s Rock Unit Classification System (BRUCS). The rank terms â€˜Suiteâ€™ and â€˜Supersuiteâ€™ are applied to (nonstratiform) intrusive rock units, as per BRUCS, contrasting with the NASC (2005), which also applied these rankings to metamorphic rock types."@en ;

In GSWA (2013), 11 landforms/primary codes were assigned to regolith units, comprising areas of outcrop, residual or relict units, and nine transported units (also see Jakica et al., 2020). Here, in this GSQ vocabulary, which is incompletely documented (after GSWA, and without classification coding), mainly only the primary subdivisions are dealt with, largely not the associated secondary landform elements/patterns (e.g., alluvial plain, stream channel, playa, freshwater lake, estuary, mangrove flat, etc.), although they are referred to in definition/notation under the primary units; these secondary units (landform qualifers) will be added subsequently. Even though this classification scheme was developed for the Yilgarn Craton and its periphery in Western Australia, its research findings have had application in other parts of Australia (Northern Territory and Queensland) and overseas, including western Africa, southern Asia, and South America (Anand et al., 1998)."@en ;
