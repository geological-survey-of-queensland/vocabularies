The majority of known BCGAs are the direct type. Direct systems require gas-prone source rocks and low permeability reservoirs to be in close proximity to each other. In indirect systems, oil and gas are both generated and expelled and migrate to reservoirs where they may even accumulate in structural and stratigraphic traps as discrete, buoyant accumulations with downdip water contacts. Hybrid systems, in which gas-prone and liquid-prone source rocks have both contributed to the development of a BCGA, may also occur. BCGAs encompass very large areas and may occur as single, isolated reservoirs a few metres or less in thickness or range up to multiple, stacked reservoirs that are several thousands of metres in thickness. Conventional and unconventional petroleum systems can coexist."@en ;
