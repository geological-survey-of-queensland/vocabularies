In the Australian Mesozoic, the Great Australian Superbasin, composed of the Nambour, Clarence-Moreton, Surat, Eromanga, Carpentaria and other basins, is a prime example, variously covering a geographically-extensive area in parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia.
