 skos:definition "OFFICIAL represents most Queensland Government information by volume, but lowest business impact per document if compromised or lost. However, where information is aggregated on an information asset such as an ICT server, the impact of compromise may increase and with it, the controls.  OFFICIAL information is routine information without special sensitivity or handling requirements. All routine public-sector business, operations and services is treated as OFFICIAL. At the OFFICIAL classification there is a general presumption that data may be shared across government. Security measures should be proportionate and driven by the business requirement.  Most OFFICIAL information is subject to the Public Records Act 2002 (Qld)."@en ;

PROTECTED information assets require a substantial degree of control as compromise could cause serious damage to the State, the Government, commercial entities or members of the public. PROTECTED information must be labelled. Cabinet information is PROTECTED. Cabinet documents (CABINET information) can be damaging to the public policy agenda and the government generally, and to the public interest. Unlawful disclosure of Cabinet information may constitute an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld), Public Sector Ethics Act 1994 (Qld) and may constitute official misconduct under the Crime and Misconduct Act 2001 (Qld). The primary guidance document to support these processes, including the handling of Cabinet material, is the Queensland Cabinet Handbook. Most PROTECTED information is subject the Public Records Act 2002 (Qld)."@en ;
