:accelerated-weight-drop a skos:Concept ; skos:prefLabel "Accelerated Weight Drop"@en ; skos:altLabel "AWD"@en; skos:definition "A mass, or striker, is held above the impact point on the ground surface. The mass may be released into freefall and then accelerated, or it may be forced by the release of compression mechanism. The mass strikes the impact point to generate a seismic pulse."@en ; skos:broader :impact ; skos:broader :onshore-seismic-source .
:air-gun a skos:Concept ; skos:prefLabel "Air Gun"@en ; skos:altLabel "Air Pulse"@en; skos:definition "Metal cylinders through which high pressure air is forced through and into the water column. The injection of air into the water creates a pressure pulse that travels through the water and into the subsurface. It is common to have multiple airguns firing at once to create an array."@en ; skos:broader :explosive ; skos:broader :offshore-seismic-source .
:boomer a skos:Concept ; skos:prefLabel "Boomer"@en ; skos:altLabel "Bang Box"@en ; skos:altLabel "Boomers"@en; skos:definition "Energy is stored in capacitors and discharges through a flat spiral coil with no spark. A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged. This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse.
